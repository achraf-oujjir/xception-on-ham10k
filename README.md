# xception-on-ham10k
In this project, we used a transfer learning approach to build an image classification model for the classification of skin lesion, we trained our model specifically on the ham10000 dataset available on kaggle and we were able to achieve a 93.6% accuracy. This is a project that I worked on with Hamza JAKOUK and Leandre PACIS.
